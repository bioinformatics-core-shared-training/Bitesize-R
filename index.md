# "Introduction to R for Biologists"


# Introduction

This site contains the materials for an R course run by the Bioinformatics Core
at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute.

April-June 2023

### Instructors

* Abigail Edwards
* Ashley Sawle
* Chandra Chilamakuri
* Kamal Kishore


# Description

**R** is one of the leading programming languages in **Data Science** and the
most widely used within CRUK CI for interacting with, analyzing and visualizing
cancer biology data sets.

In this training course, we aim to provide a friendly introduction to R pitched
at a beginners level but also for those who have been on R training courses
previously and would like a refresher or to consolidate their skills.

The course will be run over **7 weeks** with the following structure:

* **Lesson each Thursday at 9:30 am** lasting 90 minutes
* More **in-depth material** covering the concepts introduced on the Thursday lesson to go through in your own time
* A **weekly assignment** consisting of exercises to practice some of the concepts covered in that and previous week's lessons
* A member of the bioinformatics team will be assigned to you. Please contact him/her if you have any questions.
