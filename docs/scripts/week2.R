# Week 2 live coding session

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Scripts (11.05am)
# -----------------

# up till now we've been mainly using R interactively at the command prompt in
# the Console window

# most code written in R script files - lets you save your code and return to it
# in a later session, share it with colleagues, etc.

# create new R script using File menu

# type some code into it and show how it warns you it has changes that haven't
# been saved

random_numbers <- rnorm(50, mean = 0, sd = 1)
random_numbers

# show how to save the file including using the keyboard shortcut

# show how to run the command using the Run button and the keyboard shortcut
# show how running a command moves the curson on to the next command

# show how to add a comment

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Vectors (11.10am)
# -----------------

# so far we've come across the simplest data structure in R - the atomic vector
# recap what an atomic vector is - ordered set of values of same type

# 2 ways of creating a vector - : and c()

1:10
10:1
# assignment to variable
countdown <- 10:1

# : operator creates a sequence of integers
# can be increasing of decreasing, can include negative numbers
-5:5

# in practice this is most often used to get a sequence of numbers from 1 to n
n <- 20
1:n

length(countdown)

days <- c(1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16)

# c() is a function - the parentheses () are the clue

# look at help for c()
?c

# c(...) method signature shows it can take an arbitrary number of arguments
# look at description and draw attention to the various parts
# - description
# - signature
# - arguments
# - (return) value
# - see also
# - examples

# copy and paste examples
c(1,7:9)
c(1:5, 10.5, "next")

cats <- c("oscar", "tilly")
dogs <- c("snoopy", "spot")
cats_and_dogs <- c(cats, dogs)
cats_and_dogs

# can have the same value repeated
dogs <- c("snoopy", "spot", "oscar")
cats_and_dogs <- c(cats, dogs)
cats_and_dogs

# recap on coercion rules

c(TRUE, 3L)
typeof(c(TRUE, 3L))

c(FALSE, 3)
typeof(c(FALSE, 3))

c(1, "3")
typeof(c(1, "3"))

# explain why these make sense by considering each combination of logical,
# integer, double and character

# accessing elements of a vector

cats_and_dogs[4]

cats_and_dogs[c(1, 2, 4)]

# modifying elements

cats_and_dogs[5] <- "rex"
cats_and_dogs

cats_and_dogs[c(2, 5)] <- c("kitty", "milo")
cats_and_dogs

# () - function
# [] - subsetting

# parentheses are also used for ensuring the mathematical calculations are done
# in the order you intended, i.e. when normal precedence rules wouldn't work
9 + 6 / 3
(9 + 6) / 3

# excluding values
cats_and_dogs[-3]
cats_and_dogs[-c(3, 4)]

# subsetting with logical vectors
cats_and_dogs[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]
# same as cats_and_dogs[c(1, 2, 4)]
# why is this useful?

# conditional subsetting

# log2 fold changes - explain what these are, log2(after/before), and what
# values of -1, 0 and 1 mean
log2fc <- c(2.3, -1, 0.48, 0.97, -0.02, 1.23)

# extract just the log2 fold changes greater than 0.5
log2fc > 0.5
log2fc[log2fc > 0.5]

log2fc_threshold <- 0.5
log2fc[log2fc > log2fc_threshold]

# other logical operators: >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=
# can have multiple conditions using & (Boolean AND) or | (Boolean OR)

# large changes
log2fc[log2fc >= 1 | log2fc <= -1]

# small changes
log2fc[log2fc < 0.5 & log2fc > -0.5]

# can be used in modifying subsets of elements
log2fc
# e.g. to cap the maximum log2 fold change
log2fc > 1
log2fc[log2fc > 1] <- 1
log2fc

# vector arithmetic
# most operations are vectorized, the work on all elements of a vector in one go
some_numbers <- 1:10
some_numbers ^ 2

# element-by-element calculations
a <- 1:6
b <- c(3.2, 0.4, 1.6, 0.5, 1.3, 0.1)
a
b
a * b

# what if the number of elements in each vector are different?
a <- 1:6
b <- c(3.2, 0.4, 1.6)
a
b
a * b
# there are only 3 elements in b so when we get to the 4th element of a it
# starts again at the beginning of b - this is called vector recycling
a <- 1:6
b <- c(3.2, 0.4, 1.6, 0.5)
a * b
# warning message if the length of the longer vector is not a multiple of the
# length of the shorter vector

# most common operations involve 2 vectors with the same size or vectors of
# different sizes but where one vector has only 1 value, i.e. is a scalar
1:10 * 2
