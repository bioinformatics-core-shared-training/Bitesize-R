# The `mtcars` data set

## Description of the data set

There is a popular built-in data set in R called "**mtcars**" (Motor Trend Car
Road Tests), which is retrieved from the 1974 Motor Trend US Magazine. The
dataset contains measurements on *11 different* attributes for *32 different*
cars.

## More inline formatting {#inline_section}

Superscript: 32 = 2^5^

Subscript: Burning petrol creates CO~2~

Code: Later we will used the `tidyverse` package

# Using tab sets {.tabset}

## Bold

This is **bold**.

It is not ~subscript~.

## Italics

This is *italics*

## Strikethrough

This is ~~strikethrough~~

# End the tabs

To end the tabs, start a new section at the same level (or higher) as before.

# A note on linebreaks

Rmarkdown does not recognise a new line as a "line break". This is the next line, but it will stay in the same line of text.

Rmarkdown does not recognise a new line as a "line break".\
To create a break add two (or more) spaces at the end of the previous line.

# Lists (bullet points)

To create an unordered list (bullet points):

* Use an asterisk as the beginning of the line
* Each asterisk is a new bullet
* You can also use "+" or "-"
    - you can create sublists by indenting
    - using the different symbols at different levels is clearer but not 
    necessary
    
To create an ordered list use a number, a lower case letter or "i" for roman
numerals

Some animals:

1. Cat
1. Ferret
1. Dog
    a. Terriers
        i. Jack Russell
        ii. Airedale
    b. Spaniels
48. Goldfish

# Links

Basic syntax is the link text surrounded by square brackes, followed by the link
surrounded by round brackets.

## External links

[Link to the BBC home page](https://www.bbc.co.uk)

## Internal links

These are links within the document. First we need to create a tag for
the header we want to link to by adding `{#tag_name}` after the header.

[Go to inline section](#inline_section)

## Inserting images

Similar syntax to the links, but precede it with an `!`. The first part
becomes a caption

![Vectors in R](images/Vectors-in-R.jpg){width=50%}

## Manual tables

| Name        | Band        |
| :---------: | ----------: |
| Mick        | Stones      |
| John        | Beatles     |
| Paul        | Beatles     |

# R code chunks and option

They look like this

```{r}
x <- 15
y <- 20
x + y
```

## Chunk options

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- 19
y <- 20
x + y
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
x <- 19
y <- 90
a <- x + y
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 19
y <- 190
a <- x + y
```

## Chunk labels

```{r label}
z <- 10
z^8
```

## The "setup" chunk

Put this at the very start of your script. It should load all necessary packages
and set any global options (see the chunk).

## Tabular output from chunk

```{r smallTable}
smallTable <- mtcars %>%
  rownames_to_column("car") %>%
  select(car, mpg, cyl, wt) %>%
  slice(1:5)
smallTable
```

### The `kable` function

```{r}
smallTable %>%
  kable(digits = 2, align = "c")
```

# The `kableExtra` package

```{r}
smallTable %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped")) %>%
  column_spec(column = 1, bold = TRUE, border_right = TRUE)
```


Built in "themes"

```{r}
smallTable %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F)
```

## Interactive tables with `DT`

```{r}
longTable <- mtcars %>%
  rownames_to_column("car")
longTable %>%
  datatable()
```
